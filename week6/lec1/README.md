# Задание
https://github.com/timoxley/functional-javascript-workshop - complete 'Function Spies' exercise.
Investigate following questions:
  1) What are stubs, mocks? What is the difference?
  2) What is the difference between TDD and BDD?
Read about several test frameworks / setups, pick one (qunit, jasmine, mocha, ava, tape).
Do [Kata #1](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1) using it.
